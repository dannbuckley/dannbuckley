I study the propagation of drought through the use of standardized climatic indices, like the [Standardized Precipitation Index](https://climate.colostate.edu/pdfs/relationshipofdroughtfrequency.pdf), the [Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/23/7/2009jcli2909.1.xml), and the [Standardized Groundwater level Index](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-17-4769-2013)

My focus is spread across the following disciplines:
- Statistics, data science, and machine learning
- Hydrology and hydrogeology
- Climatology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences

#### 🛠️ Specialties
