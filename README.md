### Hi! Welcome to my profile!

Here's a little about me...

#### 🎓 Education
- **2024** &mdash; M.S. Geoscience-Hydrogeology, Montana Technological University ⛏️
- **2022** &mdash; B.S. Data Science, Montana Technological University ⛏️

#### 🔬 Current research interests
I study the propagation of drought through the use of standardized climatic indices, like the [Standardized Precipitation Index](https://climate.colostate.edu/pdfs/relationshipofdroughtfrequency.pdf), the [Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/23/7/2009jcli2909.1.xml), and the [Standardized Groundwater level Index](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-17-4769-2013). Among my favorite concepts are [theory-guided data science](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2720168) and [hydrological drought typology](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-16-1915-2012).

My focus is spread across the following disciplines:
- Data Science
- Hydrology and Hydrogeology
- Climatology

#### 🛠️ Specialties

- Data science: Python, R, and SQL (SQL Server)
- Systems programming: C/C++
